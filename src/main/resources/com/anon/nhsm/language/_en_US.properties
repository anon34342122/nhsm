ryujinx_text_area=Due to the non-static directory structure of Ryujinx''s save data, using it with NHSM requires you to specify the save directory of your Animal Crossing: New Horizons game. This only needs to be done once, and will be remembered with future uses of NHSM.\n\nThe folder should have a "main.dat" file inside, with the parent folder containing two folders "0" and "1". You''ll want to locate the "0" folder. The whole directory path usually looks something like this:\n\nRyujinx\\bis\\user\\save\\0000000000000001\\0\n\n"0000000000000001" folder is the part that will be different for everyone depending on when they installed and played Animal Crossing for the first time on the emulator.
