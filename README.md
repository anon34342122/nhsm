An island manager for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Allows you to manage as many islands as you want, currently supporting Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators. Written in Java using JavaFX, includes integration tests to ensure safety of island management.

## Features
* Switch another island with the local save on your chosen emulator
* Add fresh new islands
* Duplicate existing islands
* Edit the name of existing islands
* Define a description for islands
* Integrated [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE) (New Horizons Save Editor) support
* Support for English and Japanese languages

As mentioned, this also has integrated support for NHSE - whenever you click on "Save Editor", it will launch NHSE separately. If it's the first time using "Save Editor", you will be prompted to specify where the NHSE directory is once, and it will remember it for each time you try to use the Save Editor button again.
